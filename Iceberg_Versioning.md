# Mastering Snapshot Versioning in Apache Iceberg 🚀

Imagine having a time machine for your data tables — where you can instantly travel back to any version, experiment safely, and recover from mistakes effortlessly. That's the power of **Snapshot Versioning** in **Apache Iceberg**!

In this blog, we'll dive deep into **how versioning works in Iceberg**, **best practices** for managing snapshots, and **hands-on examples with code** to unleash its full potential.

## 📚 What is Snapshot Versioning in Iceberg?

Apache Iceberg is a revolutionary table format for huge analytic datasets. One of its superpowers is **Snapshot Management** — every write operation (insert, update, delete) creates a new **immutable snapshot** of the table.

Each snapshot captures:
- The **state** of the table at that time (which data files are included)
- **Metadata** like schema, partition spec, and sort order
- **Timestamps** and **operation summaries**

This enables you to:
- **Time-travel** queries
- **Roll back** to previous versions
- **Branch and tag** versions (like Git)
- **Audit** data evolution

## 🖊️ How Iceberg Organizes Snapshots

When you modify a table, Iceberg doesn't overwrite data files. Instead, it:
- Writes new **data files** (only for changed data)
- Updates **manifest files** (listing data files)
- Creates a new **snapshot** in the metadata.json

**Each snapshot has:**
- A **snapshot ID** (unique)
- A **parent snapshot ID** (for history tracking)
- A **timestamp**
- A **summary** (operation type: append, overwrite, delete, etc.)

## 📅 How to View and Manage Snapshots (with PySpark Code!)

Let's get hands-on! 🔧

Assuming you're using **PySpark** with Iceberg extensions enabled:

### 1. View All Snapshots

```python
# PySpark Example
spark.sql("DESCRIBE HISTORY mydb.mytable").show(truncate=False)
